# Prometheus

Prometheus is a very light-weight and yet powerful time-series database that is used for monitoring purposes and storing metrics data from servers and services. It has its own dedicated query language named PromQL which is very easy-to-understand.

## Setup

To run Prometheus on the server, after cloning this project, just use the below command to start it.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
